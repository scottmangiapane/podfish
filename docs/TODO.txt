SECURITY

- SameSite cookie attribute (example: `c.SetSameSite(http.SameSiteLaxMode)`)
- HTTP security headers
- Sanitize images
- Extra validation for RSS feed URLs (SSRF concerns, ex: no calls to localhost or private networks)
- "http.Dir" says it follows symlinks... Can malicious RSS feed with symlink for image read arbitrary files?
- Prevent RSS feeds (or images within feed) to invalid domains (localhost, docker hostnames like "api:3000", 0.0.0.0, etc)

API

- Simplified error handling (especially checking if gorm returned "not found" for 404, then 500 as fallback)
- Refresh JWT token as needed
- Use actual migration files instead of GORM's auto-migrate
- Validate new RSS feeds are actually RSS
- What to do if RSS feed is removed by podcast host (keep metadata in case it's temporary outage, but hide from user feeds?). Or if single episode is removed.
- Remove `/sync`

UI

- Full-width playbar on mobile
- Connect UI to playback position API
- Pagination on episode list page
- Implement "Subscribe" page
- Error handling in UI for sign up / sign in
- Playbar is hidden after sign-in, fixes with refresh
- Ensure adding/removing node dependencies is reflected in docker container (is .dockerignore to blame?).
    - Not possible? without giving up live reloading. data volume is immutable after initial build
    - Explain in README
- Recursive custom error page (ex: https://pod.scottmangiapane.com/podcasts/undefined)
- Speed up loading time of symbols font (minimized file to only include symbols I use?)
- Speed up loading time of cover art (resize images?)

OTHER

- Automatic linting on save (ex: consistent single / double quotes)
