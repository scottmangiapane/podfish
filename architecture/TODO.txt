UP NEXT

- rename podcast and subscription for consistency
- actually play tracks

SECURITY

- SameSite cookie attribute (example: `c.SetSameSite(http.SameSiteLaxMode)`)
- HTTP security headers
- Sanitize images
- "http.Dir" says it follows symlinks... Can malicious RSS feed with symlink for image read arbitrary files?
- prevent RSS feeds (or images within feed) to invalid domains (localhost, docker hostnames, etc)

API

- Better error handling (simplify for gin and gorm, maybe use logging library)
- Refresh JWT token as needed
- Support production builds in dockerfiles. Use build scripts? Don't want live reloading in prod.
- Use actual migration files instead of GORM's auto-migrate.
- What to do if RSS feed is removed by podcast host (keep metadata in case it's temporary outage, but hide from user feeds?). Or if single episode is removed.
- remove `/sync`

UI

- Ensure adding/removing node dependencies is reflected in docker container (is .dockerignore to blame?).
    - Not possible? without giving up live reloading. data volume is immutable after initial build
    - Explain in README
